                    <h1>Autobiography</h1>
                    <p>My name is Nica Marie Calanasan and I am a BS Computer Science student in the University of the Philippines - Los Baños. I am satisfactory in tech stacks such as Java, Python, and C and am eager to apply these skills into creating functional applications. My interest focuses on the intersection of logic and aesthetics; I specialize in front-end design using HTML, CSS, and Java to create fitting UI/UX components in an application. I am constantly looking for ways to utilize my creativity and am motivated to contribute to projects that prioritize both performance and the end user experience.
